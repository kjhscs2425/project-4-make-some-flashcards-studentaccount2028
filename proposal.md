2. How many times will you show each flashcard the first time the user runs your flashcards program?

I will only show each flashcard one time - I might show them their score at the end of the program to see how accurate they were

3. How will the number of times you show each flashcard change the second time the user runs the program, based on their performance the previous time?

I will use a boolean so I will only show the ones they got wrong.

4. What information will you need to store in a file in order to make the program change it's behavior each time the user runs the program?

I will need to store a boolean that shows if the user got it right or wrong making me decide if I'm going to show the flashcard again or not.
